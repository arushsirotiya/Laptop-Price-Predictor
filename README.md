- Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions
- Analyzes key features such as processor, RAM, storage, GPU, brand, and screen size
- Interactive user interface (if applicable)
- Dataset preprocessing and feature engineering for better accuracy

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-Learn
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Model Deployment: Flask/Streamlit (if applicable)

## üîß Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arushsirotiya/Laptop-Price-Predictor.git
   cd Laptop-Price-Predictor
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the model training script (if applicable):
   ```sh
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
5. Start the application (if applicable):
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training includes specifications of laptops along with their respective prices. It consists of features like:
- Brand (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.)
- Processor (Intel i3, i5, i7, Ryzen, etc.)
- RAM (4GB, 8GB, 16GB, etc.)
- Storage (HDD, SSD, size)
- Graphics Card (Integrated/Dedicated)
- Screen Size & Resolution

## Machine Learning Model
The project utilizes different machine learning algorithms, such as:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ Score**.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the dataset with more laptop models
- Enhancing model accuracy with feature engineering
- Deploying the model as a web app
- Adding user-friendly UI for easy interaction
